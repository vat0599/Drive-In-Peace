# Drive In Peace aka D.I.P
A smart vehicle assistance system which has drowsiness detection, glare detection for four wheeler along with distress call alert.

This was designed for Uber, Ola and other ridesharing organizations to enhance customer experience by ensuring they have a safe ride.
During long rides, its likely that the driver gets tired and in some rare case might fall asleep during the ride. This can cause fatal damage to both the driver as well as the customer travelling behind. Thus to ensure this never happens, a camera will be attached to the car and will monitor the eye movements (clearly undrerstands the difference between eye blinking and sleeping) of the driver and when the driver nods off, it will perform a distress call to the customer to wake the driver up along with storing the driver details in the database with the timestamp. The car will immediately slow down and will come down to an halt with sirens wailing inside the car to attract the most attention. Then after the driver is fully conscious, he/she can resume the ride by clicking a trigger button.

Similary, it is possible that while driving some shiny objects might block the view and this even though looks simple, might cause the driver to loose focus and hit somewhere. Thus, a camera is fitted in front and monitors the road continously and during such unfortunate occasions, it automatically reduces its speed in a smooth manner and moves past the danger. These intelligent systems ensure that the driver gets atmost safety and secure feeling during his/her ride and also increases the trust towards the company. The company also has an understanding towards their drivers performances and can take appropriate action for their wellbeing.
